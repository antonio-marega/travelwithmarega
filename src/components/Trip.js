Takoradi is nobody's hometown, not even the Ahantas. It is believed that, the europeans consulted the local inhabitants for the construction of the port as well as the township. The Ahantas come from Apowa, Beaho, Anaji, Assakae and surrounding areas. Everybody else in Takoradi City is a migrant, tourist or visitor."
